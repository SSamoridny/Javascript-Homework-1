# Javascript-Homework-1

In this assignment I built the password generator as described. I began with a simple wireframe that laid out what I needed to accomplish in small chunks. 

- I used prompts and confirms to ask the questions needed to satisfy the assignment requirements and build an array

- Next were the variables containing the upper case, lower case, special characters and numbers which would be used to build our final variable

- At that point I needed to have boolean comparisons to take the confirm andswers and add the variables as selected into my final array

- Now that this array was built I needed to build the formula for looping through said array randomly which I accomplished

- At this point I was able to make everything work in the console but I had not properly attached my work using the DOM manipulated items that were given to us which I then figured out. I had to change the name of one variable ('result') and apply it accordingly to match the variable given in the assignment ('password')

- Now I was just about finished but I needed to check against the how many characters parameter in my formula to make sure that either continued to function as it was or request a number between 8 - 128 which I accomplished.

At that point the assignment was complete and I was able to hand it in.
